class FloorExtractor(Module):
    """
    Will search for the specified object and splits the surfaces which point upwards at a specified level away

    Example 1, in which no height_list_path is set, here the floor is extracted automatically. By finding the group
    of polygons with the lowest median in Z direction.

            "compare_height": 0.15,  # the compare height is used after finding the floor
          }
        }

    Example 2, here the ceiling is extracted and not the floor. This is done by using the `up_vector_upwards` key,
    which is set to False here, so the polygons have to face in `[0, 0, -1]` direction. This will also flip, the search
    mechanism, now the highest group of polygons are used, not the lowest.

    Example 3, if you are using this to extract the floor of replica scenes, to place objects on top of them.

        * - height_list_path
          - Path to a file with height values. If none is provided, a ceiling and floor is automatically detected. \
            This might fail. The height_list_values can be specified in a list like fashion in the file: [0.0, 2.0]. \

            coordinates. This vector is used for the `compare_angle_degrees` option. Default: True.
          - bool
        * - add_properties
          - With `add_properties` it is possible to set custom properties for the newly separated objects. Use `cp_` \
            prefix for keys.
          - dict
        * - should_skip_if_object_is_already_there
          - If this is true no extraction will be done, if an object is there, which has the same name as
            name_for_split_obj, which would be used for the newly created object. Default: False.
