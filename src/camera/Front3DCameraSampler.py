class Front3DCameraSampler(CameraSampler):
    """
    This Camera Sampler is similar to how the SuncgCameraSampler works.

    It first searches for rooms, by using the different floors, which are used in each room.
    It then counts the amount of 3D-Future objects on this particular floor, to check if this room is interesting
    for creating cameras or not. The amount of needed objects can be changed via the config.
    If the amount is set to 0, all rooms will have cameras, even if these rooms are empty.

    The Front3D Loader provides information for using the min_interesting_score option.
    Furthermore, it supports the no_background: True option, which is useful as the 3D-Front dataset has no windows
    or doors to the outside world, which then leads to the background appearing in this shots, if not activated.

    **Configuration**:
