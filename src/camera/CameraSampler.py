class CameraSampler(CameraInterface):
    """
    A general camera sampler.

    First a camera pose is sampled according to the configuration, then it is checked if the pose is valid.
    If that's not the case a new camera pose is sampled instead.

    Supported cam pose validation methods:
    - Checking if the distance to objects is in a configured range
    - Checking if the scene coverage/interestingness score is above a configured threshold
    - Checking if a candidate pose is sufficiently different than the sampled poses so far

    Example 1: Sampling 10 camera poses.

        * - Parameter
          - Description
          - Type
        * - number_of_samples
          - The number of camera poses that should be sampled. Note depending on some constraints (e.g. interest
            scores), the sampler might not return all of the camera poses if the number of tries exceeded the
            configured limit. Default: 1.

        * - max_tries
          - The maximum number of tries that should be made to sample the requested number of cam poses per interest

          - A dictionary containing operators (e.g. avg, min) as keys and as values dictionaries containing
            thresholds in the form of {"min": 1.0, "max":4.0} or just the numerical threshold in case of max or min.
            The operators are combined in conjunction (i.e boolean AND). This can also be used to avoid the
            background in images, with the no_background: True option. Default: {}.

        * - excluded_objs_in_proximity_check

            interest score list = [1.0, 0.9, 0.8]. The sampler would reject any pose with score less than 1.0. If
            max tries is reached, it would switch to 0.9 and so on. min_interest_score = 0.8, interest_score_range =
            0.8, interest_score_step = 0.1 (or any value bigger than 0) interest score list = [0.8]. Default:
            min_interest_score.
          - float
        * - interest_score_step
          - Step size for the list of interest scores that would be tried in the range from min_interest_score to
            interest_score_range. Must be bigger than 0. " Default: 0.1.
          - float
        * - special_objects
          - Objects that weights differently in calculating whether the scene is interesting or not, uses the

          - Considers a pose novel if it increases the variance of the rotation component of all poses sampled by
            this parameter's value in percentage. If set to -1, then it would only check that the variance is
            increased. Default: sys.float_info.min.
          - float
        * - min_var_diff_translation
          - Same as min_var_diff_rot but for translation. If set to -1, then it would only check that the variance
