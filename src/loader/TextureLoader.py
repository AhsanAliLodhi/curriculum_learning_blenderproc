    """
    Depending on the form of the provided path:
    1. Loads an image, creates an image texture, and assigns the loaded image to the texture, when a path to an
    image is provided.
    2. Loads images and for each creates a texture, and assing an image to this texture, if a path to a
    folder with images is provided.

    NOTE: Same image file can be loaded once to avoid unnecessary overhead. If you really need the same image in
    different colorspaces, then have a copy per desired colorspace and load them in different instances of this Loader.

    Example 1: Load all images in the folder in sRGB colorspace and create appropriate textures.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        {
          "module": "loader.TextureLoader",
          "config": {
            "path": "path/to/folder/with/assets/"
          }
        }

    Example 2: Load a random image from the path in raw colorspace and create an appropriate texture.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        {
          "module": "loader.TextureLoader",
          "config": {
